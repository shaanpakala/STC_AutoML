'notebooks' contains the code for tensor generation as well as the code for the experiments performed (and all the tensor completion models themselves).

'classification_datasets' contains the downstream task datasets we used to generate our training tensors for our experiments.

'training_tensors' contains all the tensors we generated for evaluating Sparse Tensor Completion for our experiments.
  - see 'training_tensors/README.md' for more details
