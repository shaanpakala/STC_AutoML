#### Utilizing Sparse Tensor Completion to accelerate Non-Deep Learning Hyperparameter Optimization, Neural Architecture Search, & Database Query Cardinality estimation.

##### See demo.ipynb for usage of this application.

'notebooks' contains the code for tensor generation as well as the code for the experiments performed (and all the tensor completion models themselves).

'classification_datasets' contains the downstream task datasets we used to generate our tensors for this application.

'training_tensors' contains all the tensors we generated for evaluating Sparse Tensor Completion for this application.
  - see 'training_tensors/README.md' for more details
