# Sparse Tensor Completion for AutoML

'notebooks' contains the code for tensor generation as well as the code for the expirements performed (and all the tensor completion models themselves).

'classification_datasets' contains the downstream task datasets we used to generate our tensors for this application.

'training_tensors' contains all the tensors we generated for evaluating Sparse Tensor Completion for this application.
  - these are split up into 'deep_learning', 'non_deep', & 'query_tensors' folders


See 'demo.ipynb' for usage of this application.
