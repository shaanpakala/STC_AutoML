# Sparse Tensor Completion for AutoML

'notebooks' contains the code for tensor generation as well as the code for the expirements performed.

'classification_datasets' contains the downstream task datasets we used to generate our tensors for this application.

'meta_datasets' contains all the tensors we generated for evaluating Sparse Tensor Completion for this application.

See 'demo.ipynb' for usage of this application.
